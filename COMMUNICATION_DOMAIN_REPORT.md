# Communication Domain Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Domain:** Communication (UART, CAN, SPI, I2C, comm protocols)

---

## Incomplete Code
- Some TODOs in communication protocol headers for protocol implementation and integration.
- Not all protocol layers are fully implemented or tested.

## Code Blocked by Hardware
- SPI and I2C communication with L6470 and AS5600 require Nucleo hardware for full validation.
- Some protocol error handling and timing checks are hardware-dependent.

## Code Awaiting New Features
- Awaiting advanced protocol features (e.g., CAN diagnostics, UART performance monitoring).
- Some protocol abstraction layers are pending further development.

## Recommendations
- Complete implementation and testing of all protocol layers.
- Validate communication error handling and timing on hardware.
- Expand simulation and host testing for protocol logic.
- Use feature tracker to manage protocol enhancements and bug fixes.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule hardware-in-the-loop tests for SPI/I2C/CAN.
- Implement and validate advanced protocol features.
- Review and update all communication-related TODOs and stubs.
