# Simulation & Testing Domain Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Domain:** Simulation, Testing Framework, Host/CI Testing

---

## Incomplete Code
- Some simulation modules and test cases are marked as TODO or pending further development.
- Not all hardware behaviors are fully simulated (especially for new features).

## Code Blocked by Hardware
- Some simulation validation and test coverage require real hardware for comparison.
- Host-based tests may not fully capture hardware timing and edge cases.

## Code Awaiting New Features
- Awaiting new simulation models for advanced hardware features.
- Some test automation and CI integration is pending.

## Recommendations
- Expand simulation coverage for all hardware-dependent modules.
- Complete and automate all planned test cases.
- Integrate simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing for full coverage.
- Use feature tracker to manage simulation/testing enhancements.

**Next Steps:**
- Develop new simulation models as hardware features are added.
- Automate test execution in CI pipeline.
- Review and update all simulation/testing-related TODOs and stubs.
