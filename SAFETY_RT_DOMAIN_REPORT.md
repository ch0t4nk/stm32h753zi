# Safety & Real-Time Domain Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Domain:** Safety Systems, Real-Time Control, Watchdog, Emergency Stop

---

## Current Status (Post-Merge)
- All major safety system integration, event logging, and emergency stop broadcast features are now implemented in `safety_system.c` and related modules.
- System state management, event logging, and emergency stop broadcast are fully integrated and functional.
- All safety thresholds, limits, and configuration values are referenced from SSOT (`safety_config.h`).
- No hardcoded safety constants or violations of SSOT or `.github/instructions/safety-rt.instructions.md` were found.
- Watchdog, fault monitoring, and periodic safety checks are implemented and validated for SSOT compliance.
- All required safety functions, monitors, and fail-safes are present in code.

## Hardware Validation Required
- Full validation of emergency stop, watchdog, and hardware fail-safe mechanisms still requires Nucleo hardware and shield.
- Some safety monitoring and interrupt handling can only be tested on target hardware.

## Recommendations
- Proceed with on-target hardware validation of all safety-critical paths.
- Expand unit and integration tests for safety logic using simulation where possible.
- Continue to use the feature tracker to manage any further safety enhancements or bug fixes.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Coordinate with hardware team for on-target safety validation.
- Monitor for any new safety-related issues during hardware testing.
- Use feature tracker and STATUS.md to ensure all future safety work is traceable and SSOT-compliant.
