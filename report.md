# STM32H753ZI Stepper Motor Project: Codebase Evaluation Report

**Date:** August 13, 2025

## 1. Architecture Overview

- **Layered, Modular Design:**
  - **Application Layer:** `src/application/` (main entry, system orchestration)
  - **Controllers:** `src/controllers/` (motion, position, timing, multi-motor coordination)
  - **Drivers:** `src/drivers/` (L6470, AS5600, STM32H7 HAL, hardware abstraction)
  - **Safety:** `src/safety/` (watchdog, emergency stop, fault monitoring, failsafe)
  - **Simulation:** `src/simulation/` (motor/encoder/hardware simulation for safe dev/testing)
  - **Communication:** `src/communication/` (protocols, message handling)
  - **Config (SSOT):** `src/config/` (centralized hardware, motor, safety, comm, build, doc config)
  - **Common:** `src/common/` (data types, error codes, system state)
  - **Telemetry/Optimization:** `src/telemetry/`, `src/optimization/` (performance, efficiency, logging)
  - **HAL Abstraction:** `src/hal_abstraction/` (hardware/OS abstraction, mock/test support)

- **Entry Point:**
  - `src/application/main.c` â†’ `main_application.c` (calls `main_application_init`, `main_application_run`, etc.)
  - **Safety and watchdog are initialized before main control loop.**

- **Best Practice:**
  - **Strict SSOT:** All config is centralized in `src/config/` headers, referenced everywhere (no hardcoded values).
  - **Safety-first:** Watchdog, emergency stop, and fault monitoring are integrated at the top level.
  - **Simulation-first:** Hardware simulation is available for all major drivers.

## 2. Domains & APIs

- **Motor Control:**
  - L6470 driver (`l6470_driver.c/h`), motion/position controllers, multi-motor coordination.
  - **API:** `l6470_init`, `l6470_set_acceleration`, `l6470_set_max_speed`, etc.
  - **SSOT:** All register values, limits, and hardware mappings from `motor_config.h`, `hardware_config.h`.

- **Safety:**
  - Watchdog (`watchdog_manager.c/h`), safety system (`safety_system.c/h`), emergency stop, fault monitors.
  - **API:** `safety_system_init`, `watchdog_refresh`, `emergency_stop_trigger`, etc.
  - **Best Practice:** Safety checks and watchdog refresh are prioritized in main loop.

- **Simulation:**
  - `motor_simulation.c/h`, `hardware_simulation.c/h` provide full simulation of L6470, AS5600, and hardware faults.
  - **API:** `simulation_init`, `simulation_set_mode`, etc.
  - **Tested:** See `tests/test_simulation.c` for coverage.

- **Communication:**
  - `comm_protocol.c/h` (UART, CAN, SPI, I2C support, protocol abstraction)
  - **API:** `comm_protocol_init`, `comm_protocol_send`, etc.

- **HAL Abstraction:**
  - `hal_abstraction_stm32h7.c`, `hal_abstraction_mock.c` for hardware/OS abstraction and testability.

- **Testing:**
  - **Unit:** `tests/unit/` (Unity, GoogleTest)
  - **Integration:** `tests/test_simulation.c`, `tests/test_hal_abstraction_integration.c`
  - **Mocks:** `tests/mocks/` for HAL and driver mocking.

## 3. Notable Algorithms & Logic

- **Motion Profiling:**
  - `motion_profile.c/h` implements trapezoidal and S-curve profiles (best practice for stepper control).
- **Safety State Machine:**
  - `safety_state_manager.c/h` and `safety_system.c/h` implement robust state transitions and fault handling.
- **Simulation Framework:**
  - Realistic register-level and physics-based simulation for L6470/AS5600, with fault injection.
- **Optimization:**
  - `motor_efficiency_optimizer.c/h` (adaptive current, efficiency tuning; some TODOs remain).

---

## 4. Tools, Testing, and Simulation

- **Build:** CMake, with scripts for environment validation and formatting.
- **Testing:**
  - `tests/unit/` (unit tests, safety, HAL abstraction)
  - `tests/test_simulation.c` (simulation framework validation)
  - `tests/mocks/` (mock drivers/HAL)
- **Simulation:**
  - Full simulation mode for safe development (SIMULATION_MODE in config)
  - Hardware simulation for L6470/AS5600, including fault injection and motion patterns.
- **Automation:**
  - Pre-commit hooks for SSOT validation, link checking, and status updates.

---

## 5. STUBs, INCOMPLETE, and TODOs

- **Stub/Incomplete Areas:**
  - Many `TODO` and `STUB` comments in optimization, simulation, and some hardware abstraction code.
  - Some hardware validation steps (AS5600/L6470 wiring, magnet strength, SPI/I2C signal integrity) are marked as TODO_HARDWARE.
  - Telemetry integration and advanced logging are not fully implemented.
  - Some configuration and documentation links reference instruction files that may not be fully realized.
  - Some simulation-to-hardware transitions are not fully validated.

---

## 6. Best Practices & Items of Consequence

- **Best Practices:**
  - Centralized SSOT config, no hardcoded values.
  - Safety and watchdog are always top-level concerns.
  - Simulation-first development and testability.
  - Modular, layered architecture.
  - Extensive use of mocks and simulation for unit/integration testing.

- **Items of Consequence:**
  - Hardware connection safety is prioritized, but some hardware validation steps are still TODO.
  - Some modules (optimization, telemetry) are not production-complete.
  - Documentation is fragmented; code comments often reference instruction files.

## 7. Recommendations

### A. Moving Forward
1. **Complete Hardware Validation:**
   - Finish all TODO_HARDWARE items (AS5600/L6470 wiring, signal integrity, magnet checks).
   - Run hardware-in-the-loop tests before production deployment.
2. **Finalize Telemetry/Logging:**
   - Replace temporary logging macros with a robust, centralized logging system.
   - Complete telemetry integration for real-time monitoring.
3. **Address All STUBs/TODOs:**
   - Prioritize safety, hardware abstraction, and optimization modules.
   - Remove or replace all stub values in config headers.
4. **Expand Test Coverage:**
   - Add more integration tests for hardware abstraction and communication.
   - Increase fault injection and safety scenario testing.

### B. Centralized Documentation Plan
- **Create a `docs/code_reference/` directory:**
  - Auto-generate API docs (Doxygen) for all modules.
  - Add architecture diagrams and domain overviews.
  - Centralize all instruction file references and ensure they are up to date.
  - Provide a quick-start guide for new developers (entry points, build, test, simulation, hardware safety).
- **Integrate documentation with SSOT:**
  - All documentation paths and references should be defined in `documentation_config.h`.
  - Use semantic search and link validation scripts to keep docs consistent.

## 8. Hardware Connection Safety Assessment

- **Current State:**
  - The codebase is architected for safety, with watchdog, emergency stop, and fault monitoring always active.
  - Simulation and mock layers are robust, allowing safe development and testing without hardware.
  - **However, several hardware validation steps are still marked as TODO_HARDWARE.**
  - Some modules (optimization, telemetry) are not fully production-ready.

- **Conclusion:**
  - **Do NOT connect to hardware for production or unsupervised testing until all TODO_HARDWARE and STUBs are resolved and hardware-in-the-loop tests are completed.**
  - For supervised, stepwise bring-up (with emergency stop and monitoring), the code is in a safe state for initial hardware connection, but proceed with caution and validate each subsystem as you go.
