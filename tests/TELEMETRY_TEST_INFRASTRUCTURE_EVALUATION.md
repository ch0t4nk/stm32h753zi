# Telemetry Test Infrastructure Evaluation

## 1. Telemetry Unit Test Coverage (`tests/unit/test_optimization_telemetry.c`)

- **Coverage:**
  - Initialization, sample collection, timing, AS5600/L6470 data, safety bounds, dataset management, overflow, performance metrics, JSON export, emergency stop, invalid parameters, memory allocation, concurrency, CPU overhead.
- **Strengths:**
  - Comprehensive: Covers all major telemetry API functions and edge cases.
  - Uses Unity framework and mock HAL types for hardware abstraction.
  - Includes dataset overflow, error handling, and performance validation.
- **Limitations:**
  - Some tests are partially implemented or have TODOs for mock/stub integration (e.g., hardware response simulation).
  - Some checks are manual or structure-based due to missing API hooks (e.g., no `optimization_telemetry_is_initialized`).
  - No direct test for SSOT config propagation (relies on correct macro usage).

## 2. Related Telemetry/Characterization Tests

- **`test_phase1_3_validation.c`:**

  - Focuses on data structure correctness, dataset management, overflow, safety bounds, time constant identification, L6470 parameter calculation, performance, and mathematical accuracy.
  - Uses mock structures, not the full telemetry API, but validates core logic and memory usage.

- **`test_motor_characterization.c`:**

  - Validates integration between telemetry and motor characterization, including dataset handling and safety integration.

- **`test_telemetry_dashboard.c`:**
  - Placeholder for dashboard/packet/JSON output tests. All tests are currently `TEST_IGNORE_MESSAGE("Not implemented yet")`.

## 3. Mock Infrastructure (`tests/mocks/`)

- **Files:**
  - `mock_hal_types.h`, `stm32h7xx_hal.h`, `stm32h7xx_hal_tim.h`, `stm32h7xx_hal_def.h`, `stm32h7xx.h`
- **Purpose:**
  - Provide mock types and function prototypes for STM32 HAL, I2C, SPI, GPIO, and timer.
  - Enable compilation and linking of telemetry and hardware-dependent code in a test environment.
- **Strengths:**
  - Sufficient for basic compilation and simple mock behavior.
- **Limitations:**
  - No advanced mocking or programmable responses (e.g., no `HAL_Abstraction_MockI2C_SetResponse`).
  - Some test TODOs reference missing mock/stub functions for simulating hardware faults or responses.

## 4. Gaps and Recommendations

- **Mocking:**

  - Many tests reference or comment out calls to mock hardware response functions that do not exist.  
    _Recommendation:_ Implement programmable mocks/stubs for I2C, SPI, and safety events to enable full simulation of hardware conditions.

- **SSOT Validation:**

  - No explicit tests to verify that telemetry logic responds to changes in SSOT config headers at runtime.
    _Recommendation:_ Add tests that modify SSOT macros (via defines or test config) and verify telemetry adapts accordingly.

- **Test Completeness:**

  - Some tests are structure-based or only partially validate runtime behavior due to missing API hooks.
    _Recommendation:_ Expand the telemetry API to expose more state for testing, or add test-only hooks.

- **Integration/Regression:**

  - No integration tests for telemetry + dashboard + comms.
    _Recommendation:_ Add integration tests that exercise the full telemetry-to-dashboard-to-comm pipeline.

- **Test Execution:**
  - Some test binaries are missing/unbuilt, so tests may not be running in CI/CD.
    _Recommendation:_ Ensure all test targets are built and included in the test suite.

## 5. Summary Table

| Area                         | Coverage Level | Mocked | Gaps/Notes                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Telemetry API (core)         | High           | Yes    | Some mock TODOs, no SSOT runtime test |
| Dataset/Overflow             | High           | Yes    | Structure-based, not full API         |
| Safety/Emergency             | Medium         | Yes    | No programmable safety event mock     |
| Dashboard/Export             | Low            | No     | All tests ignored/not implemented     |
| Mock HAL                     | Basic          | Yes    | No programmable responses             |
| SSOT Config Propagation      | None           | N/A    | No explicit test                      |
| Integration (telemetry+comm) | None           | N/A    | No tests                              |

**Conclusion:**  
The telemetry test suite is broad and well-structured, but relies on basic mocks and lacks programmable hardware simulation, explicit SSOT config validation, and full integration tests. Most gaps can be closed by implementing programmable mocks/stubs and expanding test coverage for SSOT and integration scenarios.
