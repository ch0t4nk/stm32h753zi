# STM32H753ZI Real-Time Clock Analysis Report

**Timestamp**: August 15, 2025  
**Hardware**: STM32H753ZI Revision V (480MHz capable)  
**Debug Method**: STM32CubeProgrammer CLI real-time register reads

## 🔍 Current System State Analysis

### RCC_CR (0x58024400) = 0x00004025

```
Bit Analysis:
- HSI[0] = 1: HSI oscillator ON
- HSIRDY[1] = 0: HSI NOT READY ⚠️
- HSE[16] = 0: HSE oscillator OFF
- HSERDY[17] = 0: HSE NOT READY
- PLL1ON[24] = 0: PLL1 OFF
- PLL1RDY[25] = 0: PLL1 NOT LOCKED
```

**🚨 CRITICAL FINDING**: HSI is ON but NOT READY! However, our earlier analysis was INCORRECT.

**🎯 CORRECTED ANALYSIS (Based on Real-Time Debugging)**:

- **RCC_CR = 0x00004025**:
  - HSI ON (bit 0) = 1 ✅
  - HSI RDY (bit 1) = 0 ❌ (This is the problem!)
  - HSE ON (bit 14) = 1 ✅ (Code is trying HSE)
  - HSE RDY (bit 15) = 0 ❌ (Expected - no crystal on default Nucleo)

**🔍 SILICON REVISION V CONFIRMATION**:

- **Maximum Frequency**: 480MHz (CONFIRMED via CubeProgrammer)
- **CSI Calibration**: 32 (Default internal calibration)
- **HSI Calibration**: 64 (Default internal calibration)
- **VOS0 Support**: Available for 480MHz operation

### RCC_CFGR (0x58024410) = 0x00000000

```
Bit Analysis:
- SW[2:0] = 000: System clock switch = HSI
- SWS[5:3] = 000: System clock status = HSI
```

**Status**: System is correctly configured to use HSI, but HSI itself is not ready.

## 🐛 Real-Time Debugging Analysis

### Problem Identification

1. **HSI Oscillator Issue**: The HSI is enabled but not achieving ready state
2. **Clock Initialization Failure**: This suggests the Clock_Init() function is encountering an issue
3. **Potential Causes**:
   - Clock configuration timeout
   - Power supply issue during clock setup
   - Incorrect register programming sequence

### Real-Time Debugging Strategy

#### Phase 1: Immediate Register Monitoring

Monitor these registers every 2 seconds to see if there's any change:

```bash
# Core clock registers
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024400 1  # RCC_CR
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024410 1  # RCC_CFGR

# Power registers
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024818 1  # PWR_SRDCR

# System status
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0xE000EDF0 1  # Debug status
```

#### Phase 2: Step-by-Step Code Execution

Use CubeProgrammer with GDB interface to step through Clock_Init():

```bash
# Start GDB server (if available)
STM32_CubeIDE\plugins\com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.externaltools.stlink-gdb-server

# Or use CubeProgrammer's step execution
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -halt
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -step
```

#### Phase 3: Memory/Variable Inspection

Read specific variables from our clock configuration:

```bash
# Check if our safety code is being executed
# Read revision detection variable (if accessible)
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x20000000 32  # Start of SRAM
```

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Reset and Monitor Sequence

```bash
# Reset system and immediately monitor
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -rst
# Wait 100ms then read registers
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024400 1
```

### 2. Check for Clock Initialization Hang

The fact that HSI is ON but not READY suggests:

- Clock_Init() might be stuck in a while loop waiting for HSI ready
- There could be a timeout that's not being handled properly
- Power configuration might be preventing HSI from starting

### 3. Validate Power Supply Configuration

```bash
# Read all power registers
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024800 4  # PWR_CR1-PWR_CSR1
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024818 1  # PWR_SRDCR
```

## 🔧 Real-Time Debug Commands

### Continuous Monitoring Script

```bash
@echo off
:loop
echo === %time% ===
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024400 1
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0x58024410 1
timeout /t 2 >nul
goto loop
```

### Single-Step Debugging

```bash
# Halt and examine state
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -halt

# Read program counter and call stack
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -r32 0xE000EDF8 1  # PC register

# Step through code
STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD -step
```

## 📊 Expected Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Verify if HSI eventually becomes ready with more time
2. **Short-term**: Use GDB stepping to identify where Clock_Init() is hanging
3. **Analysis**: Check if our revision safety code is preventing clock configuration
4. **Resolution**: Modify clock configuration to handle timeout gracefully

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- **HSI Ready**: RCC_CR bit[1] = 1
- **System Clock Active**: RCC_CFGR SWS field shows correct source
- **No Red LED**: LD4 should turn off when clock is working
- **UART Communication**: Serial output should work with correct clock timing

---

**Next Action**: Execute continuous monitoring to see if HSI stabilizes over time, then proceed with step-by-step debugging if needed.
