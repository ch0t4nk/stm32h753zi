# Session Summary — 2025-08-21

Anchors & key timestamps

- Repo / branch: `ch0t4nk/stm32h753zi` — branch `main`.
- STATUS anchor preserved: `<!-- ANCHORS: SSOT, HAL, RTOS, BUILD -->` (left intact in `STATUS.md`).
- Auto-update script run: 2025-08-21 16:07:20 — `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/auto_update_status.py --verbose` → "No changes detected".
- Pre-commit SSOT validation run (blocked): 2025-08-21 — validator flagged include dependency in `src/tests/uart_probe_device.c`.
- Fix commit & push: 2025-08-21 — commit `1b60470` pushed to `origin/main` (message: "fix(tests): include config/motor_config.h in uart_probe_device.c").
- Files changed: `STATUS.md` (context bootstrapping + auto-update + validator record), `src/tests/uart_probe_device.c` (SSOT include added).

Domain state (concise)

- Hardware:
  - Target MCU: STM32H753ZI (Nucleo‑144).
  - ST-Link VCP observed on host (COM port used in capture: COM5 during attempts).
  - Safety constraint enforced: `SAFE_NO_MOTOR_POWER` default ON; probe firmware built/flashed with motor power disabled.
- Build / CI:
  - Firmware (ARM) builds succeed (128 files compiled, ELF/BIN/HEX produced).
  - Host-tests: host-only builds present but some host tests failing; test triage in progress.
- SSOT / Validation:
  - SSOT validator available as pre-commit; initially blocked commit due to missing include, now passes after minimal fix.
  - `STATUS.md` updated and contains the Context Bootstrapping note.
- Diagnostics so far:
  - UART probe image flashed and verified.
  - Host serial capture produced empty logs.
  - Read-only SWD register reads show USART3 peripheral not clocked (APB enable bits = 0) and GPIOD registers returned all-ones — suggests peripheral not initialized or bus domain issue.
  - DBGMCU IDCODE read: device/revision consistent (used for errata).

Decisions (major choices / design directions)

- Safety-first policy: no hardware actions that could enable motor power without explicit user approval; `SAFE_NO_MOTOR_POWER` enforced.
- SSOT-first approach: add/configure all hardware constants through `src/config/*` and validate with `scripts/validate_ssot.py`.
- Probe-first diagnostics: build and flash a minimal UART probe (no motor outputs) before any stronger probes (halt/LED flash).
- Non-destructive debugging: prefer read-only SWD reads and host-side captures before halting/resuming MCU or toggling hardware power rails.
- Minimal fixes in-tree: apply the smallest code change to satisfy pre-commit SSOT (added `#include "config/motor_config.h"`), commit, and push.

Code Snippets (concise, representative)

- Probe banner emit (from `uart_probe_device.c`):

```c
static void probe_uart_banner(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart, const char *name) {
    char banner[64];
    int len = snprintf(banner, sizeof(banner), "PROBE:%s\r\n", name);
    if (len > 0) {
        HAL_UART_Transmit(huart, (uint8_t *)banner, (uint16_t)len, 200);
    }
}
```

- Minimal SSOT include fix (applied):

```c
#include "config/comm_config.h"
#include "config/motor_config.h"   // <- added to satisfy SSOT validator
```

- Auto-update command used:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/auto_update_status.py --verbose
```

Open Questions (unresolved issues / uncertainties)

- Why the UART probe is silent:
  - Is the flashed probe actually executing (VCP mapping / early reset/bootloader interactions)?
  - Are USART3 clocks or GPIOs being disabled by reset state, alternate core/domain, or the running image?
- Hardware routing questions:
  - Are the on-board SB straps / solder-bridge settings routing ST-Link VCP to the expected MCU pins (PD8/PD9) in this board revision/config?
- Host interference:
  - Was another process intermittently opening the COM port during captures? (Device Manager exact COM# and port ownership need confirmation.)
- Halt-and-inspect:
  - Should we halt the CPU and read PC/SP/vector table now (read-only check)? User approval required.
- Next-test selection:
  - If halt-inspect is inconclusive, do we want to flash a visual-only LED blink probe (explicit permission required) to confirm code execution independent of UART?
- PR vs direct push:
  - Current flow pushed fix to `main`. If PRs are required by workflow, should we revert and open a PR instead? (User preference.)

Next Steps (concrete action items)

- Immediate (user approval required for hardware actions):
  1. Confirm whether to run a read-only halt-and-inspect now (halts CPU, reads PC/SP and a small flash memory region at PC).
  2. Confirm the Windows Device Manager COM# for ST-Link VCP and whether to re-run live manual capture during reset.
- Short term (no-risk / repo actions I can run now): 3. I can open a PR with a detailed description and release notes summarizing the `STATUS.md` update and the SSOT fix (branch: `fix/ssot-include-uart-probe`). 4. Triage host-test failures: run failing host test binary under debugger or re-run with added instrumentation (requires a short isolated build in `build_host_tests`).
- Medium term (with explicit approvals where needed): 5. If UART remains silent after halt/inspect and wiring checks, build/flash a blink-only probe (no motor rails) and confirm visual execution. 6. If physical board routing is ambiguous, request a quick photo of the solder-bridge area (SB straps) or confirm wiring to finalize routing diagnosis.
- Documentation / housekeeping: 7. Keep `STATUS.md` updated with the results of each step (auto-update + validator run recorded). 8. If you want automated CI trigger, I can open a PR and request a zero-touch CI workflow run (confirm PR workflow).

Compact checkpoint (what changed since last checkpoint)

- Ran auto-update (no changes).
- Recorded auto-update output in `STATUS.md`.
- Pre-commit SSOT blocked commit due to missing include; applied minimal include fix and committed & pushed `1b60470` to `origin/main`.
- `STATUS.md` now contains the Context Bootstrapping note and validator record.

If you want me to proceed now — reply with one clear option:

- "Halt-and-inspect OK" — I will perform the read-only halt/inspect now.
- "Do LED probe" — I will prepare and (with explicit flash approval) build/flash a blink probe.
- "Open PR" — I will create a PR branch and open a PR with release notes.
- "Stop" — I will pause and leave the current state as-is.
