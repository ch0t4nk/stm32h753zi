# VS Code CMake Kit Configuration Summary

## What Was Configured

VS Code has been configured with proper ARM GCC toolchain support for STM32H753ZI development:

### 1. CMake Kits (`.vscode/cmake-kits.json`)
- **ARM GCC for STM32H753ZI (Debug)**: Primary development kit
- **ARM GCC Release**: Optimized release builds
- Both kits use the custom ARM toolchain file at `cmake/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake`

### 2. CMake Toolchain (`cmake/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake`)
- ARM Embedded GCC cross-compiler configuration
- STM32H753ZI specific CPU parameters (Cortex-M7, FPU, etc.)
- Proper compiler and linker flags for embedded development
- Debug/Release build configurations

### 3. VS Code Settings Updates
- CMake extension configured to use Ninja generator
- IntelliSense configured for ARM GCC
- Code formatting and C/C++ standards set
- ARM toolchain paths properly configured

## How to Use

### In VS Code:
1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`** (Command Palette)
2. **Type**: `CMake: Select a Kit`
3. **Choose**: `ARM GCC for STM32H753ZI`

### Alternative:
- VS Code should now automatically detect the kit
- The CMake extension will use the ARM GCC toolchain for builds
- You can build using the VS Code tasks or CMake extension UI

### Verification:
- The CMake extension should show "ARM GCC for STM32H753ZI" as the active kit
- Build configurations: Debug/Release should be available
- IntelliSense should work with ARM-specific headers and definitions

## Build Commands:
```bash
# Configure (should now work automatically)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake

# Build
cmake --build build

# Using VS Code tasks
Ctrl+Shift+P -> "Tasks: Run Task" -> "Build (CMake)"
```

The kit selection dialog should now have proper options and CMake will use the ARM GCC toolchain correctly!
