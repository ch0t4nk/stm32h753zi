# Documentation Archives

This directory contains archived documentation that has been superseded by current project documentation.

## Archive Categories

### 📋 Milestone Reports (`milestone_reports/`)
Historical milestone completion reports that are now comprehensively covered in the root `STATUS.md`:
- HAL abstraction implementation and completion reports
- Infrastructure setup completion
- Semantic search integration completion  
- Status automation phase completion reports
- Documentation update completion

**Superseded by**: `/STATUS.md` - Comprehensive project status with all milestone information

### 📊 Analysis Reports (`analysis_reports/`)
Technical analysis documents from development phases:
- Test compilation analysis (pre-HAL abstraction)
- Test framework status analysis
- Documentation conversion analysis

**Superseded by**: Current working implementations and STATUS.md technical sections

### 💾 Historical Status (`historical_status/`)
Previous status tracking files before STATUS.md consolidation:
- Development status snapshots
- Timestamped project status files  
- Workspace status documents

**Superseded by**: `/STATUS.md` - Live status tracking with automation

### 🗃️ Backups (`backups/`)
Backup files from development process:
- Old CubeMX configuration backups
- Development snapshot files

**Superseded by**: Current active configuration files

## Archive Policy

Files are archived (not deleted) when they:
1. ✅ Are fully superseded by current documentation
2. ✅ Represent completed milestones documented elsewhere  
3. ✅ Are historical snapshots no longer needed for active development
4. ✅ Maintain historical value for project development understanding

Files are NOT archived if they:
- ❌ Contain unique technical information not found elsewhere
- ❌ Are actively referenced by current documentation
- ❌ Provide implementation guidance still needed for development

## Access Pattern

All archived content remains in git history and can be restored if needed:
```bash
# View archived file
git show HEAD~N:path/to/archived/file.md

# Restore archived file if needed  
git checkout HEAD~N -- path/to/archived/file.md
```

**Archive Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Archive Reason**: Post-HAL abstraction milestone cleanup, STATUS.md consolidation
