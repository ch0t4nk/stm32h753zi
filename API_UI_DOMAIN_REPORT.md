# API & UI Domain Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Domain:** API Design, User Interfaces, External Integration

---

## Incomplete Code
- Some API endpoints and user interface hooks are marked as TODO or pending implementation.
- Documentation references to API/UI integration are present but not all features are implemented.

## Code Blocked by Hardware
- Some UI feedback and API endpoints depend on real hardware state (e.g., motor status, safety events).

## Code Awaiting New Features
- Awaiting new API endpoints for advanced diagnostics, remote control, and monitoring.
- Some UI features are pending further design and integration.

## Recommendations
- Complete implementation of all planned API endpoints and UI features.
- Integrate API/UI with real hardware feedback as soon as possible.
- Expand automated and manual testing for API/UI components.
- Use feature tracker to manage API/UI enhancements and bug fixes.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Finalize API/UI design and implementation.
- Integrate with hardware and safety systems for real-time feedback.
- Review and update all API/UI-related TODOs and stubs.
