# Hardware Domain Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Domain:** Hardware (drivers, HAL abstraction, hardware config)

---

## Incomplete Code
- Many TODOs and stubs in `hal_abstraction/hal_abstraction_stm32h7.c` and `hal_abstraction_mock.c` for hardware error handling and initialization.
- Some hardware abstraction functions are placeholders or return error codes by default.

## Code Blocked by Hardware
- AS5600 and L6470 driver functions are hardware-gated (require Nucleo board and shield for real operation).
- Magnet detection, I2C/SPI communication, and status register reads are not fully testable without hardware.
- Comments like `HARDWARE_GATING`, `TODO_HARDWARE`, and `STUB_REMOVAL` indicate code that must be validated on target.

## Code Awaiting New Features
- Some hardware abstraction layers are awaiting new feature implementations (e.g., advanced diagnostics, parameter validation).
- Hardware simulation is present but not a full replacement for on-target testing.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize bring-up and validation of AS5600 and L6470 hardware interfaces.
- Replace stubs with real error handling and diagnostics as hardware is tested.
- Document all hardware dependencies and gating clearly in code and feature tracker.
- Continue to improve hardware simulation for CI and host testing.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule hardware test sessions for AS5600/L6470.
- Update abstraction layers as hardware issues are discovered/resolved.
- Expand simulation coverage for hardware-dependent code.
