# STM32H753ZI Real-Time Debugging Results

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Hardware**: STM32H753ZI Revision V  
**Debug Session**: CubeProgrammer CLI Real-Time Analysis

## 🔍 **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### Current System State (RCC_CR = 0x00004025)

```
✅ HSI Oscillator: ON (HSION = 1)
❌ HSI Ready: NOT READY (HSIRDY = 0)
✅ HSI Kernel: READY (HSIKERON = 1)
✅ HSE Oscillator: ON (HSEON = 1)
❌ HSE Ready: NOT READY (HSERDY = 0)
❌ PLL1: OFF and NOT LOCKED
```

### System Clock Status (RCC_CFGR = 0x00000000)

```
🎯 Clock Source: HSI (SW = SWS = 0)
⚠️  System: Running on 64MHz HSI fallback
```

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

**The clock initialization code is enabling both HSI and HSE but neither oscillator is achieving ready state.**

This explains:

- Why the system is running (HSI kernel is providing 64MHz clock)
- Why LD4 is red (clock initialization failed)
- Why there's no UART output (wrong clock frequency for baud rate)

## 🛠️ **PROBABLE CAUSES**

### 1. **HSI Not Ready Issue**

- HSI is ON but HSIRDY never sets
- This could indicate:
  - Power supply instability during startup
  - Incorrect voltage scaling configuration
  - Hardware issue with internal oscillator

### 2. **HSE Not Ready Issue**

- HSE is ON but HSERDY never sets
- This is expected on default Nucleo configuration:
  - SB121 closed, SB122 open = ST-LINK MCO mode
  - HSE crystal path is not connected by default
  - Code shouldn't be trying to use HSE

## 🎯 **REAL-TIME DEBUGGING CONCLUSIONS**

### What's Working:

✅ STM32CubeProgrammer connection  
✅ Flash programming (54KB firmware loaded)  
✅ CPU execution (running on HSI kernel)  
✅ Register access via ST-LINK  
✅ Revision V silicon confirmed (480MHz capable)

### What's Failing:

❌ HSI ready flag (HSIRDY = 0)  
❌ HSE ready flag (HSERDY = 0)  
❌ Clock_Init() completion  
❌ PLL configuration and lock  
❌ Target frequency achievement (480MHz or even 240MHz)

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### 1. **Fix Clock Initialization Logic**

The issue is likely in our `Clock_ConfigureHSI()` function where we're waiting for HSI ready:

```c
// Current code probably has:
while(!__HAL_RCC_GET_FLAG(RCC_FLAG_HSIRDY)) {
    // This loop never exits!
}
```

**Solution**: Add timeout and error handling.

### 2. **Disable HSE Configuration**

Since Nucleo default config doesn't support HSE crystal:

```c
// Remove HSE attempts in Clock_Init()
// Focus only on HSI → PLL → SYSCLK path
```

### 3. **Add Debugging Output**

Insert debug prints in Clock_Init() to see exactly where it's hanging:

```c
printf("Clock_Init: Starting...\r\n");
printf("Clock_Init: HSI configuration...\r\n");
printf("Clock_Init: HSI status = 0x%08X\r\n", RCC->CR);
```

## 📊 **NEXT DEBUGGING SESSION**

### Phase 1: Code Analysis

1. **Examine Clock_Init()** - look for infinite loops waiting for ready flags
2. **Check HAL_RCC_OscConfig()** - verify timeout handling
3. **Review voltage scaling** - ensure VOS0 is set correctly before high frequency

### Phase 2: Step-by-Step Execution

```bash
# Set breakpoint in Clock_Init()
# Step through each oscillator configuration
# Monitor RCC_CR after each HAL call
```

### Phase 3: Simplified Clock Configuration

```c
// Test with minimal HSI-only configuration
// Skip PLL initially, just get HSI working
// Then add PLL step by step
```

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- **HSI Ready**: RCC_CR bit[1] = 1 (HSIRDY)
- **PLL Lock**: RCC_CR bit[25] = 1 (PLL1RDY)
- **Target Clock**: 480MHz or at least 240MHz achieved
- **LD4 Off**: No red LED indicating successful initialization
- **UART Working**: Serial communication with correct timing

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHT**

The system is actually running and responsive - it's just running on the wrong clock source due to initialization failure. This is much better than a complete system fault and suggests the issue is in software logic rather than hardware damage.

---

**Recommended Next Action**: Focus on the Clock_Init() function and add proper timeout handling for oscillator ready flags.
