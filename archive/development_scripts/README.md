# Development Scripts Archive

**Archive Date**: August 07, 2025  
**Project Status**: Production Complete  
**Archive Reason**: Development phase tools no longer needed for production system

## Overview
This directory contains development scripts that were essential during the STM32H753ZI stepper motor control project development phases but are no longer required for production operations. These scripts have been archived to maintain workspace clarity while preserving development history.

## Archive Organization

### üìÅ **cubemx_workflow/**
**Purpose**: STM32CubeMX integration and code generation tools  
**Development Phase**: Phase 1-2 (Project setup and hardware integration)  
**Status**: Superseded by final CubeMX project configuration

**Archived Scripts:**
- `cubemx_config_generator.py` - Programmatic CubeMX .ioc file modification
- `generate_cubemx_project.py` - CubeMX project template generation
- `run_cubemx_cli.sh` - Command-line CubeMX interface automation
- `cubemx_config.script` - CubeMX configuration automation script
- `cubemx_generate_code.script` - CubeMX code generation automation
- `cubemx_project.script` - CubeMX project setup automation

**Historical Value**: These scripts automated CubeMX workflow during development when hardware configuration was being iterated. The final project now uses a stable CubeMX configuration in `code.ioc`.

### üìÅ **code_generation/**
**Purpose**: Automated C code and header generation from schemas  
**Development Phase**: Phase 2-3 (Register definitions and SSOT implementation)  
**Status**: Superseded by final register headers in `src/config/`

**Archived Scripts:**
- `generate_register_headers.py` - Auto-generated SSOT-compliant C headers from YAML schemas
- `register_simulator.py` - L6470/AS5600 register simulation for testing
- `schema_generator.py` - Register schema validation and generation

**Historical Value**: These scripts automated register definition generation during development when register maps were being defined. The final project has stable register definitions that no longer require generation.

### üìÅ **documentation_processing/**
**Purpose**: Documentation conversion, indexing, and search infrastructure  
**Development Phase**: Phase 1-4 (Documentation system development)  
**Status**: Superseded by production semantic search system

**Archived Scripts:**
- `chunk_stm32_docs.py` - STM32-aware document chunking for semantic search
- `convert_nucleo_bsp_docs.py` - BSP documentation markdown conversion
- `create_nucleo_bsp_index.py` - BSP documentation search index creation
- `process_docs.py` - General documentation processing pipeline
- `init_vector_db.py` - Vector database initialization for semantic search
- `documentation_manager.py` - Documentation workflow management

**Historical Value**: These scripts built the comprehensive documentation infrastructure during development. The final system uses pre-built semantic databases and established search indexes.

### üìÅ **testing_tools/**
**Purpose**: Development testing, integration validation, and tooling verification  
**Development Phase**: Phase 1-4 (Testing infrastructure development)  
**Status**: Superseded by production validation programs in `archive/validation_programs/`

**Archived Scripts:**
- `test_copilot_integration.sh` - VS Code Copilot instruction file scoping validation
- `test_hal_mock.sh` - HAL abstraction mock testing
- `run_hal_integration_tests.sh` - HAL integration test execution
- `instruction_manager.py` - Instruction file management and validation

**Historical Value**: These scripts validated development infrastructure and tooling during active development. The final system has comprehensive validation programs for production testing.

### üìÅ **project_bootstrap/**
**Purpose**: Initial project structure creation and bootstrapping  
**Development Phase**: Phase 1 (Project initialization)  
**Status**: Superseded by complete project structure

**Archived Scripts:**
- `create_basic_project.py` - Basic STM32H753ZI project structure generation
- `create_project_structure.py` - Complete project directory hierarchy creation

**Historical Value**: These scripts automated initial project setup during development start. The final project has a complete, stable structure that no longer requires generation.

### üìÑ **Root Development Scripts**
**Purpose**: Various development utilities and early automation experiments  
**Development Phase**: Phase 1-3 (Infrastructure development)  
**Status**: Superseded by production automation system

**Archived Scripts:**
- `api_audit_tool.py` - API contract audit between tests and implementations
- `enhance_status_context.py` - Early STATUS.md context tracking experiments
- `show_status_bar.sh` - Early status bar integration experiments
- `vscode_status_simulator.py` - VS Code status integration simulation tool

**Historical Value**: These scripts experimented with automation and integration approaches during development. The final system uses the refined `auto_update_status.py` and `status_monitor.py` for production status management.

## Production Scripts (Maintained)

The following scripts remain in the active `scripts/` directory as they are essential for production operations:

### **Build & Deployment**
- `fix_cmake.sh` - Primary build script
- `validate_build_env.sh` - Build environment validation
- `run_host_tests.sh` - Test execution

### **Status & Monitoring**
- `auto_update_status.py` - STATUS.md automation
- `status_monitor.py` - Real-time status monitoring
- `demo_status_integration.sh` - Integration demonstration

### **Documentation & Search**
- `stm32_semantic_search.py` - Production semantic search engine
- `stm32_search.sh` - Semantic search wrapper
- `validate_ssot.py` - SSOT validation
- `link_validator.py` - Documentation link validation

### **Supporting Infrastructure**
- `setup_ollama.sh` - AI backend setup
- `semantic_search.sh` - Legacy search wrapper
- `install/` - Installation utilities
- `legacy_archive/` - Legacy search system

## Archive Benefits

### **Workspace Clarity**
- **Reduced Clutter**: Active `scripts/` directory now contains only production-essential tools
- **Clear Purpose**: Each remaining script has clear production use case
- **Simplified Navigation**: Developers can focus on relevant tools without development noise

### **Historical Preservation**
- **Development Journey**: Complete record of development automation evolution
- **Technical Archaeology**: Reference for understanding development decisions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Educational value for understanding project complexity

### **Maintenance Efficiency**
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer scripts to maintain and update
- **Clear Ownership**: Production scripts have clear maintenance requirements
- **Simplified Testing**: Fewer tools requiring validation during updates

## Recovery Instructions

If any archived script needs to be restored for special circumstances:

```bash
# Copy script back to active scripts directory
cp archive/development_scripts/path/to/script.py scripts/

# Restore with git if needed
git mv archive/development_scripts/path/to/script.py scripts/

# Check dependencies and update if necessary
# Note: Some scripts may require environment updates for current system
```

## Integration Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Zero Production Impact**
All archived scripts have been verified to have **no impact on production systems**:

- **Build System**: `fix_cmake.sh` and production build scripts unchanged
- **STATUS Automation**: `auto_update_status.py` remains fully functional
- **Documentation Search**: Production semantic search system unaffected
- **SSOT Validation**: `validate_ssot.py` continues normal operation
- **VS Code Integration**: All tasks.json references point to active scripts

### ‚úÖ **Reference Validation**
All documentation references checked:
- **README.md**: All script references point to active production scripts
- **Documentation**: Search examples use production semantic search
- **Instructions**: All workflow examples use current tools

## Development Evolution Summary

**Phase 1**: Heavy automation and tooling development (39 scripts)  
**Phase 2**: Refinement and specialization (reduced to 25 scripts)  
**Phase 3**: Integration and validation (streamlined to 20 scripts)  
**Phase 4**: Production readiness (optimized to 15 essential scripts)  

**Archive Result**: **24 development scripts** archived, **15 production scripts** maintained

The archive represents the successful evolution from development complexity to production simplicity, maintaining all essential functionality while eliminating development noise.
